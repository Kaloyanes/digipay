MPoC (Mobile Payments on COTS) is a relatively new PCI standard that establishes security requirements for accepting card data and PINs on the same mobile device, comments especially for DIGIPAY Blog Pavel Kaminsky, Founder and CEO, 7Security and Member of the Advisory Board of DIGIPAY 2023. It enables technology providers to optimize and significantly improve the payment experience for merchants and consumers.

Soon we expect the first MPoC certified solutions, which will unlock the potential of embedded payments in 2024. Merchants and service providers will be able to integrate MPoC certified SDKs into their mobile applications, thus transforming them into a variety of modern payment tools. Loyalty and rewards programs and embedded finance will shape 2024, and MPoC is one of the keys that will open the door to their development.
